        as the Akoko, Akure, Apoi, Idanre, Ijaw, Ikale, Ilaje, Ondo and the Owo. Ondo State,
        which is indeed a microcosm of the Nigerian nation, is blessed with resourceful,
        industrious and hospitable people. Her crop of educated elite has led to its being classified

        1,761,263 males and 1,679,761 females, the people of the state are mostly subsistence farmers, fishermen and traders.
        /n The state is bounded in the north by Ekiti and Kogi States; in the east by Edo State; in the west by Oyo and Ogun States,
        and in the south by the Atlantic Ocean.
